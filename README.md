# Exoplanet Exploration

### Linear Regression

This model returned a best value of .650.

### Logistic Regession

This model returned a best value of .636.

### Random Forest

This model returned a best value of .767 and was the best model.

### K Nearest Neighbors

This model returned a best value of .588.

### Neural Network

This model returned a best value of .708.

### Deep Neural Network

This model returned a best value of .745.


None of the models performed very well.  The Random Forest and Deep Neural Network were the best models.  This was a difficult dataset to model as there were many features and there were similarities in the features among all three categories.
